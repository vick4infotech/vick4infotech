# 👋🏾 Hey there, Code Traveler! Welcome to Victor’s Dev Universe 🚀  

Hi! I’m **Victor Moyinoluwa Ayenikanju** – your friendly neighborhood **Developer Advocate** (and unofficial tour guide through the maze of my GitHub repos).  
Think of me as the person who brings coffee, memes, and clarity to your code journey ☕✨.  

I live at the intersection of **DevOps, Developer Education, and Real-World Problem Solving**. Here you’ll find my **projects**, **resources**, **research**, and a dash of Nigerian ingenuity 🟩⬜🟩.  


## 🌍 About This Place  

This GitHub isn’t just a repo dump. It’s a **developer playground** where:  

- You’ll find **production-grade systems** (HiCare, Abujalet, Competition Management System).  
- You’ll bump into **learning materials** I’ve curated or built (Python, React, Blockchain DevOps, youth empowerment resources).  
- You’ll discover how **developers work** — because I also research dev workflows, tools, and pain points (yes, I’m the nerd with the clipboard 📋).  


## 🧑🏾‍💻 A Little About Me  

- **Current Role**: Developer Advocate (aka your developer translator, problem solver, and vibe curator).  
- **Technical Toolbox**: Python, React, CI/CD, AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL, IT Security, Data Protection.
